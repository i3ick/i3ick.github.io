		<p>
		Another project done in collaboration with TrailerFarm, this time for the LEGO game LEGO Brawls. It was a
		delight to be able to work on my first LEGO project with an amazing team. I was given a lot
		of freedom in adding my personal touch with some goofy gags. Responsible for all 3D animation starting from 0:39

		<p>
		Near the end of 2020 I was contacted by The TrailerFarm to join the FallGuys cinematic trailer team. I started out helping
		the background character team on the Season 3 trailer which was just wrapping up. Afterwards I continued as a full time animator
		on the DOOM trailer, Season 4 trailer, and Season 5 trailer.

		<div class="title">Joann Sfar's TV series | Production Design | 2020</div>
		<p>
		Joséphine Meis and I were contacted by Joann Sfar to work on his upcoming TV shows. The task was to create final
		frame illustrations that would accureately represent the shows for pitching. We were essentially responsible for
		the production design of the two shows: figuring out how to draw the backgrounds, props, effects, and what color
		pallets should be used. Getting to work with Joann's characters and worlds was a very fun experience and I can't
		wait to be able to share the work we've done. Currently all the content is under NDA, so bellow you will find the
		short animation that got us this job after Joann Sfar noticed it on Twitter.
